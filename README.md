# Overview
Welcome to my flutter app!  The code on this repository is all about an app I made in Flutter.  I was curious about what FLutter was so I decided to put something small together to see how the Flutter framework worked.  Like the title of the repo sayas, this is a calculator appiclation.  It can do simple math wit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Now this app is nothing fancy.  It was a fun little project to just explore the world of making apps through Flutter.  I have learned that Flutter can be really useful in making apps that work for both Android and IOS devices.  

Now this app may not be the prettiest thing on the block.  If I were to send this to the app store, I would have to make more improvemnets to the styling of the app and possible add more features.  One fun tings to note, was I had previous code that I made using the Dart language.  Now Dart is used with Flutter and kinda acts like Javascipt.  The program I had previously was a calculator in the terminal.  It worked fine, but I wanted to see if I could get it to work on a user interface and I have successfully done so.  I would not say that it is finished.  It can use some work to make it prettier, but for now it was a great thing to explore over the two weeks I play around with this software.  I hope to make more imporvements in the future if time allows.

# Development Environment

The development Enviorment I used was Android Studios.  Android Studios is a software by Google that allows you to make Molbile apps.  Though it can be buggy at times, it does allow you to run simulations of various types of phones.  This is nice because you can be aware of how you app looks on an Android device as well as an Apple device.  Android studios can use languages like Java, Kotlin, Swift, and Dart.

With Android Studios, I used a langauge called Dart.  This language was supposed to be made to rival or maybe even replace Javascript, but obvously that did not happen.  When Flutter came around, it took Dart and used the language for its framework of building apps.  Flutter is a useful tool that helps makes designing apps a tiny bit easier.  Flutter uses things called 'Widgets' for cetain elemnts of the page.  If your good enough, you can make your own widget to use.  For this project though, I simply made many containers in flutter, then linked those containers to other dart files that would run the calculations.  I then made each container reponsive to touch so it would work like buttons.

# Future Work
* Improve the Styling of the Interface
* Add more functionality like decimal numbers and making number negative.
